Welcome to the GitHub repository for the 2015 NCME Training Session: Leveraging Open Source Software and Tools for Statistics/Measurement Research.
This version controlled repository contains or links to all the resources associated with the training session.  During this training session you'll be introduced
to ideas and technologies associated with [open science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) and [reproducible research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility). 

Traditional work-flows associated with statistics/measurement research currently runs counter to many of the principles associated with open science and reproducible research. 
In this training session, we introduce participants to some widely used [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) tools that overcome many of the limitations of 
the closed traditional statistics/measurement research work-flow. Modern development tools and practices can be utilized as part of statistics/measurement 

As the title of the title of the training session suggests, participants will need a laptop computer with some open source programs installed to participate in the
training session. The information that follows introduces the software/tools and provides information on how to install The programs/tools we'll
use include: 

* [:octocat: GitHub](https://github.com/), a web-based [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) repository hosting service.
* [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) a free and open source [integrated development environment (IDE)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) 
for [**R**](http://cran.r-project.org/).
* [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), a universal document/format converter that utilizes [LaTeX](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html).

One of the most difficult parts of using modern software/tools for this type of research is just getting your work environment (i.e., your laptop) set up with the tools. But once
set up, the benefits are huge.  Welcome to the bleeding edge. :smile:   


### GitHub

Version control of content is fundamental to reproducible results. Version control has been used by software developers for decades as a way of collaborating and managing the chaos that
ensues when multiple programmers are developing using the same software codebase. [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) is a modern distributed version control system created by 
[Linus Torvalds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), the creator of the [Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) operating system. [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a 
web-based version control system based upon [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) with many other bells and whistles that is extremely popular for open source development. 
[Netflix](http://netflix.github.io/#repo) uses [GitHub](https://github.com/) for its source code development. Beyond source code development, the whole idea of “version control” has been 
implemented with [German law](http://bundestag.github.io/gesetze/) where all laws [GitHub](https://github.com/) in a version controlled fashion so people can examine the law and its development.

For this training session, we'll be using [GitHub](https://github.com/) for version control. You'll need to do two things:

* Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. Public repositories are free and 
* Install a [GitHub](https://github.com/) client on your compute. [Mac](https://mac.github.com/), [Windows](https://windows.github.com/), or [Linux](http://www.maketecheasier.com/6-useful-graphical-git-client-for-linux/). Git is a command line application, but it's easier to start with a GUI client.


## Training Session Schedule

**8:00 to 9:15** Overview of open research/dissemination and the tools/platforms that support it. First hour will be a presentation/overview and the last 15 minutes we’ll 
confirm everyone is set up with the appropriate software on their computers. Advanced instructions will be sent out regarding software needed for the training session.

**9:15 to 9:30** Break

**9:30 to 11:00** Introduction to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and version control. This part of the training session will introduce users to the version control via GitHub. Users will learn how to 
fork a repository, modify that fork, make and accept pull requests.

**11:00 to 12:00** Introduction to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), the static HTML website part of all GitHub repositories. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) allows projects 
to produce websites associated with projects that can include highly sophisticated components including interactive graphics, blogs, and vector math fonts. With a basic distributed 
version control repository as its foundation.

**12:00 to 1:00** Lunch

**1:00 to 2:00** Introduction to [**R**](http://cran.r-project.org/) and its system of user created packages. [**R**](http://cran.r-project.org/) is an open source environment for statistical
analysis that has growth tremendously in use over the last decade. A major part of its success is its extensability: Users can create their own packages that extend the functionality of 
[**R**](http://cran.r-project.org/). These packages can be distributed via [**R**](http://cran.r-project.org/)'s [CRAN]([**R**](http://cran.r-project.org/) based package installation
or utilize [GitHub](https://github.com/) as the package repository. In a very real sense, one is *standing on the shoulder of giants*!

**2:00 to 3:00** 

**3:00 to 3:15**

**3:15 to 5:00**
