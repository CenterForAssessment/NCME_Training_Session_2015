Welcome to the GitHub repository for the 2015 NCME Training Session: Leveraging Open Source Software and Tools for Statistics/Measurement Research.
This version controlled repository contains or links to all the resources associated with the training session.  During this training session you'll be introduced
to ideas and technologies associated with [open science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) and [reproducible research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility). 

Traditional workflows associated with statistics/measurement research currently runs counter to many of the principles associated with open science and reproducible research. 
In this training session, we introduce participants to some widely used [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) tools that overcome many of the limitations of 
the closed traditional statistics/measurement research workflow. Modern development tools and practices can be utilized as part of statistics/measurement 

As the title of the title of the training session suggests, participants will need a laptop computer with some open source programs installed to participate in the
training session. The information that follows introduces the software/tools and provides information on how to install The programs/tools we'll
use include: 

* [:octocat: GitHub](https://github.com/), a web-based [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) repository hosting service.
* [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) a free and open source [integrated development environment (IDE)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) 
for [**R**](http://cran.r-project.org/).
* [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), a universal document/format converter that utilizes [LaTeX](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html).

One of the most difficult parts of using modern software/tools for this type of research is just getting your work environment (i.e., your laptop) set up with the tools. But once
set up, the benefits are huge.  Welcome to the bleeding edge. :smile:   


### GitHub

Version control of content is fundamental to reproducibility. Version control has been used by software developers for decades as a way of collaborating and managing the chaos that
ensues when multiple programmers are developing using the same software codebase. [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) is a modern distributed version control system created by 
[Linus Torvalds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), the creator of the [Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) operating system. [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a 
web-based version control system based upon [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) with many other bells and whistles that is extremely popular for open source developement. 
[Netflix](http://netflix.github.io/#repo) uses [GitHub](https://github.com/) for its source code development. Beyond source code development, the whole idea of “version control” has been 
implemented with [German law](http://bundestag.github.io/gesetze/) where all laws [GitHub](https://github.com/) in a version controlled fashion so people can examine the law and its development.

For this training session, we'll use a go to the [GitHub](https://github.com/) website and download a
