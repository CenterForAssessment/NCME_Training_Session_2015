Welcome to the GitHub repository for the 2015 NCME Training Session: Leveraging Open Source Software and Tools for Statistics/Measurement Research.
This version controlled repository contains or links to all the resources associated with the training session.  During this training session you'll be introduced
to ideas and technologies associated with [open science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) and [reproducible research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility). 

Traditional workflows associated with statistics/measurement research currently runs counter to many of the principles associated with open science and reproducible research. 
In this training session, we introduce participants to some widely used [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) tools that overcome many of the limitations of 
the closed traditional statistics/measurement research workflow. Modern development tools and practices can be utilized as part of statistics/measurement 

As the title of the title of the training session suggests, participants will need a laptop computer with some open source programs installed to participate in the
training session. The information that follows introduces the software/tools and provides information on how to install The programs/tools we'll
use include: 

* [:octocat: GitHub](https://github.com/), a web-based [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) repository hosting service.
* [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) a free and open source [integrated development environment (IDE)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) 
for [**R**](http://cran.r-project.org/).
* [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), a universal document/format converter that utilizes [LaTeX](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html).

One of the most difficult parts of using modern software/tools for this type of research is just getting your work environment (i.e., your laptop) set up with the tools. But once
set up, the benefits are huge.  Welcome to the bleeding edge. :smile:
