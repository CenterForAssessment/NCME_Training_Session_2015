Welcome to the GitHub repository for the 2015 NCME Training Session: Leveraging Open Source Software and Tools for Statistics/Measurement Research.
This version controlled repository contains or links to all the resources associated with the training session.  During this training session you'll be introduced
to ideas and technologies associated with [open science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) and [reproducible research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility). 

Traditional workflows associated with statistics/measurement research currently runs counter to many of the principles associated with open science and reproducible research. 
In this training session, we introduce participants to some widely used [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) tools that overcome many of the limitations of 
the traditional statistics/measurement research workflow. 

As the title of the title of the training session suggests, we will require users to utilize a computer with some open source programs installed.
